	<Info>Anti-DBG: INT 3 is a standard software breakpoint (opcode 0xCC). Whenyou set a breakpoint, your debugger replaces the first opcodeunder the breakpoint location with a 0xCC (INT 3). When the debugger hits this opcode it breaks and restores the originalopcode. We add an exeption handler that switches 'found' from true to false. Without a debugger, *something must* handle the breakpoint exception (which is our handler). If our handler doesnot get hit, it means a debugger attempted to handle the exception itself, an in turn, leaving 'found' marked true.
