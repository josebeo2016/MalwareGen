	<Info>Anti-Sanbox: 	This trick is about performing a low number of seconds to sleep but in a loop, the reason behind that sandboxes tries to avoid patching such sleeps because it could lead to race conditions and also because it is just negliable. However, when you do it in a loop, you can make it efficiant to cuz the sandboxe to reach its timeout.</Info>
